Square #1

Write a class `Square` that inherits from `Rectangle`.

Requirements:

* Implement a new class called `Square`
* `Square` should have a constructor that takes one argument: `size`
* `size` should be private and can be accessed through `Square`'s public `area` method - no getter or setter
* `size` must be a positive integer, validated by `integer_validator`
* Implement the `area` method to compute the area of the square (size * size)
* Since `Square` is a subclass of `Rectangle`, `Square` should also have its own version of `__str__` method to print its dimensions in the format `[Square] <size>/<size>`

Example:

>>> s = Square(13)
>>> print(s)
[Square] 13/13
>>> print(s.area())
169
