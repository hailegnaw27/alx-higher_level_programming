Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class; otherwise False.

Prototype: `def inherits_from(obj, a_class):`
You are not allowed to import any module.

Example:
>>> a = True
>>> if inherits_from(a, int):
...     print("{} inherited from class {}".format(a, int.__name__))
...
>>> if inherits_from(a, bool):
...     print("{} inherited from class {}".format(a, bool.__name__))
...
True inherited from class bool

>>> c = 24
>>> if inherits_from(c, int):
...     print("{} inherited from class {}".format(c, int.__name__))
...
24 inherited from class int

>>> d = []
>>> if inherits_from(d, list):
...     print("{} inherited from class {}".format(d, list.__name__))
...
[] inherited from class list
