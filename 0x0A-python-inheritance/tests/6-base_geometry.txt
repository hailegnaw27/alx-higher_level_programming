Improve Geometry

Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).

Requirements:

* Implement a new public instance method `area(self):` that raises an `Exception` with the message `area() is not implemented`
* You are not allowed to import any module.

Example:
>>> from models.base_geometry import BaseGeometry
>>> bg = BaseGeometry()
>>> try:
...     print(bg.area())
... except Exception as e:
...     print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))
[Exception] area() is not implemented

You are not allowed to import any module.
