Rectangle

Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).

Requirements:

* Implement a new class called `Rectangle`
* `Rectangle` should have a constructor that takes two arguments: `width` and `height`
* `width` and `height` should be private and can be accessed through `Rectangle`'s public `area` method - no getter or setter
* `width` and `height` must be positive integers, validated by the `integer_validator` method inherited from `BaseGeometry`
* Implement `__str__` method so that it returns the following string:[Rectangle] <width>/<height>

Example:

>>> r = Rectangle(3, 5)
>>> print(r)
[Rectangle] 3/5
>>> print(dir(r))
[...'_Rectangle__height', '_Rectangle__width'...]

>>> try:
...     print("Rectangle: {} - {}".format(r.width, r.height))
... except Exception as e:
...     print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))
[AttributeError] 'Rectangle' object has no attribute 'width'

>>> try:
...     r2 = Rectangle(4, True)
... except Exception as e:
...     print("[{}] {}".format(e.__class__.__name__, e))
[TypeError] height must be an integer
