Full Rectangle

Write a class `Rectangle` that inherits from BaseGeometry.

Requirements:

* Implement a new class called `Rectangle`
* `Rectangle` should have a constructor that takes two arguments: `width` and `height`
* `width` and `height` should be private and can be accessed through `Rectangle`'s public `area` method - no getter or setter
* `width` and `height` must be positive integers, validated by the `integer_validator` method inherited from BaseGeometry
* Implement the `__str__` method so that it returns the following string: `[Rectangle] <width>/<height>`
* Implement the `area` method to return the area of the rectangle (width * height)

Example:

>>> r = Rectangle(3, 5)
>>> print(r)
[Rectangle] 3/5
>>> print(r.area())
15
